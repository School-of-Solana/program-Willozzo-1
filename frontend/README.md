### Usage

## Buttons Overview
The frontend provides three main actions, each accessible via dedicated buttons:

- **Initialize Blog**:

Click the **Initialize Blog** button to set up a new blog account.
Ensure your wallet is connected and has sufficient funds for the transaction. 

- **Create Post**:

Use the "Create Post" button to add a new post.
Fill in the title and content fields before submitting the form.

- **Fetch Posts**:

Press the "Fetch Posts" button to retrieve and display all posts from the blog

**Note**: If during the transaction approval you see a message stating that the transaction is reverted, approve the transaction anyway, as you are on localhost.
